= Configuring a fresh Tumbleweed installation for writing OCP docs

This all seems to work as of TW snapshot 20220111.

== Prerequisites

* `sudo zypper ref`, `sudo zypper dup`

* Ruby 3.0.3 or greater--this should already be installed for YaST, but `ruby -v` to confirm.

== Procedure

1. Install GNU make, gcc, and gcc-c++: `sudo zypper install make gcc gcc-c++ `
2. Install the ascii_binder gem: `gem install ascii_binder --user-install`
3. Add the user-install gems binary directory to your path. This will probably pop up as a warning, but as an example, it might look like `/home/johnsmith/.local/share/gem/ruby/3.0.0/bin`
4. `cd` to the openshift-docs directory and run ascii_binder: `ascii_binder.ruby.3.0`
+
You can symlink, rename, etc., to your heart's desire, but if this command works, you're good.
5. Clean up the preview you generated: `ascii_binder.ruby.3.0 clean`
